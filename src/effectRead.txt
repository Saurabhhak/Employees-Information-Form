Side effects kya hote hain?

Timer / auto-hide

API call (conditional)

State change ke baad kuch aur karna

Cleanup (clearTimeout, remove listener)
“I use useEffect only for side effects 
that depend on state changes, like timers, 
UI synchronization, or cleanup—not for direct user actions.”
